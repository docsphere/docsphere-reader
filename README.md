# Quasar Documentation++
(WORKING IN PROGRESS)

> An Alternative Documentation of Quasar Framework.

The proposal of this project is to join in one place, everything of the Quasar Documentation: the theoretical part ([quasar.dev](https://quasar.dev/ "quasar.dev")), showcases ([Quasar Play](https://quasar-framework.org/quasar-play/android/index.html#/showcase "Quasar Play")),  showcases source codes ([from github](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-play/tree/dev/src/pages/showcase "from github")) and changelogs.

You can clone this repository, run on a **web server** and have access to everything from the Quasar Framework completely **offline** on your computer!
You can also **compile** for **mobile** and **desktop** devices.

In addition, we have created many features that make it easy to study and search for specific information within the Quasar Documentation++.

Some features of this documentation are listed below!
See the projects tab for more details!

## Features
### Internationalization with i18n
We want the documentation to be available in any language so that it can reach **everyone**.

Currently available in 2 languages: English (en) and Portuguese (pt).

### Menu search engine based in keywords and i18n (Beta)
The search for content in the documentation is simple, fast and easy.
The search input text in the **menu** makes it easy to **search** for any content **using keywords** and you can do it in your favorite language.
If the defined language is not English and if the search term is not found or has not been set in current language, by default a search is still performed using keywords in English.

### Source code highlighted (Beta)
This documentation generates codes with Syntax highlighting from texts with multiline and line indented stored in translatable i18n files. So you can access the codes of the documentation **offline** and we can also use i18n for example to translate code comments.

### Navigation using anchored links (RC)
Anchor links work in hash and history mode and provide **faster navigation** and **better orientation** when navigating through subsections of documentation.

### Partial code view in the showcase (TODO)
...

### Component builder with output of source code (TODO)
...
