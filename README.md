Finally, the "Vs" subpage allows you to compare your project with other technologies and competitors in your industry. Use this page to show why your project is superior and how it can benefit users in ways that other products can't.

## Features

### Internationalization with i18n

We want the documentation to be available in any language so that it can reach **everyone**.

Currently available in 2 languages: English (en) and Portuguese (pt).

### Menu search engine based in keywords and i18n (Beta)

The search for content in the documentation is simple, fast and easy.
The search input text in the **menu** makes it easy to **search** for any content (headers, texts, source codes, ...) **using keywords** and you can do it in your favorite language.
If the defined language is not English and if the search term is not found or has not been set in current language, by default a search is still performed using keywords in English.

### Source code highlighted (Beta)

This documentation generates codes with Syntax highlighting from texts with multiline and line indented stored in i18n files. So you can access the codes of the documentation **offline** and we can also use i18n for example to translate code comments.

### Navigation using anchored links (RC)

Anchor links work in hash and history mode and provide **faster navigation** and **better orientation** when navigating through subsections of documentation.
