# Quasar Documentation++
(WORKING IN PROGRESS)

> All-in-one Quasar Framework Documentation: Overview, Showcase (Examples), Showcase Code (Source Code of Showcase) and Changelog.

The purpose of this project is to bring together the theoretical, Showcase, Source Code of Showcase and Changelogs of the Quasar documentation in one place.
In addition, we have created several features that make it easy to study and search for specific information within the Quasar documentation.

We want to create resources that meet those goals. Some features are listed below:
- Partial Source Code View inside the Showcase
- Component Builder with source code

See the projects tab for more details!

## Features
### Internationalization (i18n)
We want the documentation to be available in any language so that it can reach everyone.

Currently available in 2 languages: English (en) and Portuguese (pt).
Wait for the CONTRIBUTING.md file to initiate a contribution to this repository.

### Menu search engine based in keywords and i18n
The search for content in the documentation is simple, fast and easy.
The search input text in the **menu** makes it easy to search for any content using keywords and you can do it in your favorite language.

### Documentation codes in local files
A JSON file that is processed by the Gist is downloaded and stored in **local files**. These files contain `.vue`, `.js`, `.html`, or `.css` codes that are used in the documentation so that you can access all of the documentation **offline**.

### Anchor links to faster navigation and orientation (WIP)
