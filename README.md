# Quasar Documentation++
(WORKING IN PROGRESS)

> All-in-one Quasar Documentation: Overview, Showcase (Examples), Showcase Code (Embeded source code of Showcase) and Changelog.

The purpose of this project is to bring together the theoretical, examples, source code and changelogs of the Quasar documentation in one place.
In addition, we have created several features that make it easy to study and search for specific information within the Quasar documentation.

We want to create resources that meet those goals. Some features are listed below:
- Partial Source Code View inside the Showcase
- Component Builder with source code
- Offline Code View

See the projects tab for more details!

## Resources
### Internationalization (i18n)
We want the documentation to be available in any language so that it can reach everyone.

Currently available in 2 languages: English and Portuguese.
Make a contribution to more languages!

### Menu search engine based in keywords and i18n
The search for content in the documentation is simple, quick and easy.
The input text in the **menu** makes it easy to search for any content using keywords and you can do it in your language.

### Documentation codes in local files
A JSON file that is processed by the gist is downloaded containing `.vue`, `css`, `script`, or `html` codes that are used in the documentation so that you can access all of the documentation **offline**.

### Partial Source Code View inside the Showcase (WIP)

### Component Builder with Source Code (WIP)
